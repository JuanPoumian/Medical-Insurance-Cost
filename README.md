![HealthFitness](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114705723/222254587-7520f2cc-8af7-43fc-84a3-5fb91b92a27e.png)

I researched and analyzed medical insurance costs data from **2015**.

# Data
The data is under the name **insurance.csv** and contains the following variables:
* age: age of primary beneficiary.
* sex: insurance contractor gender, female, male.
* bmi: Body mass index, providing an understanding of the body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height, and objective index of body weight (kg / m ^ 2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9.
* children: Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents.
* smoker: Smoking.
* region: the beneficiary's residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest.
* charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance.

# EDA
Here is a glimpse of the questions that I answered through my analysis:
* What is the composition and distribution of the data?.
* Is there a relationship between the variables "sex" and "smoker"?.
* Is there a relationship between the variables "bmi" and "charges"?.

The file 'insurance_medical_cost' contains the full insights that I have uncovered through my complete analysis.
